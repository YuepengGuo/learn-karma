Not only can *data* be "real" but so can *testing* (in "real" browsers)!

#### What is Karma?

If you've never heard of Karma, prepare to have your mind blown! :-)

**Official Description**: Karma is a [test automation] tool that spawns a web 
server and executes source code against test code for each of the browsers 
connected. The results for each browser are examined and displayed via the 
command line so developers can see which browsers and tests passed or failed.

In other words, you can **automatically** test all your front-end code
in **any** / **all** your target browsers each time you save your work.

#### Get Started

If you are learning by cloning this repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:nelsonic/learn-karma.git
```
then install karma locally:

```sh
npm install
```

Otherwise, if you are going to run Karma for all your projects 
(because you think its *awesome*):

```sh
sudo npm install -g karma
````
