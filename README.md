#### What is Karma?

If you've never heard of Karma, prepare to have your mind blown! :-)

Official Description: Karma is a Test Automation tool which spawns a web server 
and executes source code against test code for each of the browsers connected. 
The results for each browser are examined and displayed via the command line 
so a developer can to see which browsers and tests passed or failed.
